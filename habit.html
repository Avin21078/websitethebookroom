        <h2>Why Build a Reading Habit?</h2>
        <p>Focus and concentration.<br> Boosts vocabulary and imagination.<br>Reduces stress and helps you relax.<br> Gives you a healthy break from screens.</P>
        <h2>How to Start : </h2>
        <p>Set a Small. Achievable Goal. Start with just 5 to 10 minutes a day. <br> Pick the Right Book. Choose something you&apos;re genuinely excited about, not just what&apos;s “popular.” <br> Make It Part of Your Routine, Tie reading to an existing habit (e.g. after breakfast, before bed).</p>
        <h2>Common Obstacles & How to Overcome Them :</h2>
        <p>“I&apos;m too busy.” → Break reading into small chunks; 5 minutes is better than none. <br> “I lose interest.” → Don&apos;t force yourself to finish every book — it&apos;s okay to DNF (Did Not Finish). <br> “I get distracted.” → Find a quiet spot and put your phone in another room. </p>
        <h2>Staying Consistent</h2>
        <p>Track your progress in a journal or app. <br> Join a reading challenge or book club. <br>  Reward yourself for milestones (finished a book? Treat yourself!). <br> Share what you&apos;re reading with friends to stay motivated. </p>
