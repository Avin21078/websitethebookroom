            <h2>About Us : </h2>
            <p>Welcome to our little reading room, where books meet busy lives. <br> I believe reading shouldn&apos;t feel like a chore or an impossible luxury. <br> It should be a daily joy, a habit that fits seamlessly into your life, no matter how packed your schedule may be.</p>
            <h2>Our Story : </h2>
            <p>It all started with a simple problem: I wanted to read more, but life kept getting in the way. <br> Between school, work, and everyday distractions, our “to be read” piles only grew taller. <br> So, I decided to change that by creating a space filled with practical tips, encouragement, and book recommendations designed for real people with real schedules.</p>
            <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
            <p> Whether you&apos;re : <br> A reluctant reader looking for the right book to hook you <br> A busy student trying to squeeze in 10 minutes a day <br> Or a lifelong bookworm searching for your next favourite story you&apos;re in the right place. </p>
            <h2>What We Offer : </h2>
            <p>Tips & Guides, learning how to create healthy reading habits, find the time to read, and make it a consistent joy.<br> Book Recommendations, to pick your next read without the overwhelm.</p>
